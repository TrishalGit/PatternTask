# Cup and Handle Pattern Detection System

A high-accuracy (99% target) cup and handle pattern detection system for Binance Futures data with comprehensive validation and visualization capabilities.

## 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a system that identifies "Cup and Handle" patterns in Binance Futures data (1-minute timeframe, 2024-2025) with at least 99% accuracy, detecting and validating 30+ distinct patterns.

## 📊 Pattern Formation Logic

### Cup Requirements
- Smooth, rounded bottom shape (parabolic fit R² > 0.85)
- Left and right rims at similar price levels (±10% tolerance)
- Cup depth ≥ 2x average candle size
- Duration: 30-300 candles

### Handle Requirements
- Short consolidation after the cup (5-50 candles)
- Sloped downward or sideways
- Handle high ≤ cup rim levels
- Retracement ≤ 40% of cup depth

### Breakout Requirements
- Bullish breakout above handle resistance
- Breakout ≥ handle high + 1.5x ATR(14)
- Volume spike preferred (bonus validation)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Code Imputs and Contribution
- Had to learn about cup and handle patterns and try to understand variations in the handle region and breakout value more. Watched some youtube videos and mostly clarified structure through the help of ChatGPT.
- For base line code and most of the plotly code its generated by using Cursor and vscode + github Co-Pilot a little free tire versions. The core logic code and edge cases identification is done by me.
- I only got 28 valid cup and handle patterns out of the data. I haven't added invalid case graphs.

### Core Components

1. **DataDownload.py** - Downloads BTC/USDT futures data from Binance
2. **pattern_detector.py** - Enhanced pattern detection with 99% accuracy validation
3. **plot_utils.py** - Advanced visualization with kaleido image export
4. **main.py** - Complete workflow orchestration

### Key Features

- **Multi-level Validation**: Comprehensive validation rules for pattern quality
- **Smooth Rendering**: High-quality image export using kaleido
- **Statistical Analysis**: R² scoring, ATR calculations, volume analysis
- **Visual Annotations**: Clear marking of cup, handle, and breakout zones
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy tracking and quality distribution analysis
- **Test Cases and Coverage**: Added basic test cases for pattern_detector.py This is not complete was trying to generate test valid and invalid cases using ChatGPT but have to spend more time to fix the conditions and code. So left it there.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Data

```bash
python DataDownload.py
```

### 3. Run Pattern Detection

```bash
python main.py
```
### 4. Run Tests and Coverage

```bash
pytest test_pattern_detector_pytest.py
```

```bash
pytest --cov=pattern_detector --cov-report=term-missing test_pattern_detector_pytest.py
```
## 📈 Validation Rules

### ✅ Validation Criteria
- Cup depth ≥ 2x average candle size
- Cup duration: 30-300 candles
- Handle duration: 5-50 candles
- Handle high ≤ cup rim levels
- Handle retracement ≤ 40% of cup depth
- Parabolic fit R² > 0.85
- Breakout ≥ handle high + 1.5x ATR(14)

### ❌ Invalidation Rules
- Handle breaks below cup bottom
- Handle duration > 50 candles
- V-shaped cup (low R² fit)
- No breakout after handle formation
- Rim levels differ > 10%

### Additional conditions that were included
- For 10% diff between Left rim and Right rim is taken from
minimum value in a 301 candle window and not from 0 for the price heights.
- The polynomial fit curve coefficient for x^2 is considered valid if its greater than (depth/((len(cup_candles) - 1)^2)) for better (U) shaped curve.
- To check handle_high is less than left/right rim. Handle highs are only taken till the fall region.

### Further Updates
- Can be updated to convert to a trading bot which process every data tick sequentially
- Currently it only produces results for (U) shaped cup and handle patterns. There could be (reverse U) shaped patterns also.
- Before building a trading bot need to analyse the PNLs sharpe ratio, dradowns, with certain cutoff limits for stop loss and closing the trade instances and check the statistics.
- This code is built with strict conditions. Can use Machine learning model not sure as of now what features to be built and the data region to be considered for prediction. Might be some valid patterns can be marked invalid by the ML model and some extra patterns can be marked valid. The accuracy can be measured by (True positive / (True positive + False Positive + False Negative))

## 🔧 Configuration

### Detection Parameters
```python
# Adjustable in main.py
min_size = 30          # Minimum cup duration
max_size = 300         # Maximum cup duration
min_r2 = 0.85          # Minimum R² for parabolic fit
```
- Can change Start and End Date time for reduced processing of data in main.py
- Can limit the number of plots saved to the folder in main.py
- Set save_images flag to False to see the html view of plots in better way

### Validation Thresholds
```python
# Adjustable in pattern_detector.py
rim_tolerance = 0.1    # Rim level similarity (10%)
depth_ratio = 2.0      # Cup depth vs candle size
retracement_limit = 0.4 # Handle retracement limit (40%)
atr_multiplier = 1.5   # Breakout ATR multiplier
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Accuracy Calculation
- Valid patterns / Total detected patterns
- Target: 99% accuracy
- Quality distribution by R² scores

### Quality Categories
- **High Quality**: R² ≥ 0.9
- **Medium Quality**: 0.85 ≤ R² < 0.9
- **Low Quality**: R² < 0.85

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Mathematical Components
- **Parabolic Fitting**: Quadratic regression for cup shape validation
- **ATR Calculation**: 14-period Average True Range for breakout validation
- **Volume Analysis**: 20-period SMA for volume spike detection
- **Linear Regression**: Handle trend analysis

### Algorithm Flow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: OHLCV data preparation and technical indicators
2. **Swing Detection**: Identify potential cup rims and maxima
3. **Pattern Validation**: Apply comprehensive validation rules
4. **Handle Analysis**: Detect and validate handle formation
5. **Breakout Confirmation**: Verify breakout with ATR and volume
6. **Quality Assessment**: Calculate R² and final validation status

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Edge Case Handling
- Gap handling in data
    - When checking 10% differenc between rim levels the price was very high. So had to reduce the left and right rim price difference
- Robust error handling
- Performance optimization

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Detection
```python
from pattern_detector import detect_cup_handle_patterns
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("data/BTCUSDT_futures_1m.csv")
df["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(df["timestamp"])
df.set_index("timestamp", inplace=True)

# Detect patterns
patterns = detect_cup_handle_patterns(df)
print(f"Detected {len(patterns)} patterns")
```

### Custom Visualization
```python
from plot_utils import plot_interval

# Plot specific pattern
plot_interval(df, patterns_df, start_idx=0, end_idx=1, save_images=True)
```
